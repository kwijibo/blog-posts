If you have several values which might be `null`, and you want the first 'truthy' value, one way is to use a sequence of ORs:

```
const c = a || b || 0

```
The trouble is, while this style is concise, it only works if the only values you care about are 'truthy'.
`false`, `null`, `undefined`, `0`, `NaN` and `""` all evaluate as false. This is a problem for our example, because `0` is a valid value for `c`, but if `a` is `0`, we still fallback to `b`:

```
const a = 0
const b = 1
const c = a || b || 0
//=> c === 1
```

So a more correct version might be:

```
const c = Number.isInteger(a)? a : 
                (Number.isInteger(b)? b : 0)
```
A downside to this is that code working with `a` and `b` has to know how to test whether `a` and `b` are values we can use in this context. This test logic may have to be duplicated, leaking into other parts of the code. 

`Maybe` lets us push this logic upstream into the functions accessing the values in the first place - returning `Just(Integer)` or `Nothing` instead of `Integer` or `null` (or `undefined` or ...). We already know how to fallback from a Maybe to a default value with `.getOrElse(defaultValue)`. But how can we fall back from one Maybe to another?

```
const a = Nothing()
const b = Just(1)
const c = a.getOrElse(b.getOrElse(0))
```
This is one way, but the nesting, like all nesting, is a little painful, and will get more painful as we increase the number of Maybes we need to fallback through.

A nicer way is to use the [`alt algebra`](https://github.com/fantasyland/fantasy-land#alt) from Fantasy Land. We can define it for Maybe very simply:
```
const Just = x => ({
   alt: A => Just(x)
// also define map, chain, getOrElse ... 
})
const Nothing = () => ({
   alt: A => A
// also define map, chain, getOrElse ... 
})
```
or, if Maybe is defined in a prototype style:
```
Just.prototype.alt = function(A){ return this }
Nothing.prototype.alt = function(A){ return A }
```
In other words, `Just(something).alt(A)` always returns `Just(something)` and `Nothing().alt(A)` always returns `A`.

This lets us write
```
const c = a.alt(b).getOrElse(0)
```
and fallback through many Maybes without nesting:
```
const z = y.alt(x).alt(w).alt(v).getOrElse(42)
```

(At the time of writing, [Sanctuary](https://sanctuary.js.org/) is the only library to implement `Maybe.alt` - but it [may be about to move](https://github.com/fantasyland/fantasy-maybes/issues/8) to [fantasyland/fantasy-maybes](https://github.com/fantasyland/fantasy-maybes))

### Alt Tasks

You can also imagine implementing it for `Task`:
```
const Task = fork => ({
    alt: A => Task(function(reject, resolve){
        fork(
            err => { A.fork(reject, resolve) },
            success => resolve(success)
        )
    }),
    fork
    //define map, chain, ap...
})
Task.of = x => Task((_, resolve) => resolve(x))
```
Used like:
```
writeToA
.alt(writeToB)
.alt(writeToC)
.fork(
    err => console.error("failed to write to A, B & C", err),
    success => console.log("Wrote successfully to one of A, B or C", success)
)
```

### Alt Task Maybe

Slightly trickier is alternating between a `Task Maybe` composition. eg, you want to perform a lookup on one server, and if you don't find a result, look on a second server.
```
const doubleAlt = A => B => A.chain(a => 
    a.alt(a.constructor.empty()).equals(a) ? A.constructor.of(a) : B
).alt(B)

const A = Task.of(Nothing())
const B = Task.of(Just(42))

doubleAlt(A, B)
.map(m=>m.getOrElse(0))
.fork(
      console.error
    , console.info
) // => 42
```

How `doubleAlt` works is, we use `chain` to look inside the first Task, and if the inner Maybe is equal to an empty Maybe (ie, a `Nothing`), we return the second Task. Otherwise, we return the first Task. In addition, we use `.alt` on the outer Task to catch the first Task `reject`ing.
